    <Header as="h3">Check sprints</Header>
    <p>
      You can check one or more sprints at a time for each cohort in the sprint phase, by selecting
      the radio buttons. Please be aware that this is process and time intensive and takes a long
      time to load. Once we have data storage for the Github data, this will be much faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once it loads, you can expand to see each student&apos;s commit history by clicking the github
      button next to their name. Apologies ahead of time because design it&apos;s not great UI/UX
      design. Anybody want to make it better???
    </p>

    <Header as="h3">Check teams</Header>
    <p>
      The projects tab will allow you to view the lifetime commit history of each team, as well as
      the last week&apos;s worth of commits and code changes. This one takes even longer to check...
      once again, once we have date storage this will be much faster.
    </p>

    <Header as="h3">If it&apos;s out of date</Header>
    <p>
      If this is still running with config files, the deployed repo will need to add new data to its
      config files, for example, add new students/cohorts.
